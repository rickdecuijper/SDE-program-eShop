The program demonstrates multiple **software design patterns** across creational, structural, and behavioral categories. It is implemented in **Java** and designed for clarity and modularity.

**Team Members:**  
- Rick – contributed to creational, structural, and behavioral patterns (Singleton, Composite, Observer)
